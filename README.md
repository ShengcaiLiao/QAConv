# QAConv
Interpretable and Generalizable Person Re-Identification with Query-Adaptive Convolution and Temporal Lifting

This PyTorch code is proposed in our paper [1]. A Chinese blog is available in [再见，迁移学习？可解释和泛化的行人再辨识](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ukZgCsGdig0jE6jmkpBbbA).

# Updates

* 11/26/2020: Include the IBN-Net as backbone, and the [RandPerson](https://github.com/VideoObjectSearch/RandPerson) dataset.

# Requirements

- Pytorch (>1.0)
- sklearn

# Usage
Download some public datasets (e.g. Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, CUHK03-NP, MSMT) on your own, extract them in some 
folder, and then run the followings.

## Training and test
python main.py --dataset market --testset duke[,market,msmt] [--data-dir ./data] [--exp-dir ./Exp]

For more options, run "python main.py --help". For example, if you want to use the ResNet-152 as backbone, specify "-a resnet152". If you want to train on the whole dataset (as done in our paper for the MSMT17), specify "--combine_all".

## Test only
python main.py --dataset market --testset duke[,market,msmt] [--data-dir ./data] [--exp-dir ./Exp] --evaluate

# Performance

Performance (%) of QAConv with ResNet-152 under direct cross-dataset evaluation without transfer learning or domain adaptation:
